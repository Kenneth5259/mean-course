# MeanCourse

This is a full stack SPA application built on the MEAN stack as part of a course through Udemy. 
It is a barebones social media website with user authentification, file upload, and authentification
dependent components. Also will be updates to tie posts to specific user identificaiton.


Was previously deployed on an ec2 instance on AWS but was removed becuase I did not like the maintenance fees.
